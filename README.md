How to run the application ?

I have used npm to build the project. Please follow the below steps to run the app.

Unzip the file
Open the terminal and go to the project directory
Run “npm run serve”
Open a browser preferabbly google chrome and go to this url http://localhost:8080/#/#tags=red

You can add multiple colours in URL by using comma(,) seperator like http://localhost:8080/#/#tags=red,green,blue

You can also add colour by entering a valid color name in the input box and click on “Add color” button. 

To remove a color just click on any color shown from the list. 

You can also type “Enter” key in your keyboard to add the color. I  have also done a small validation, If you type whitespace and click on add color button, it should give an error saying “Please enter a valid color”.


Below are the details for the assigned task. All I have done except one (I have mentioned).


Test - Frontend
The assignment

Create a static HTML page
Place an element list (UL) in that
Load your page with URL containing #tags=red,blue,purple at the end
Write a Javascript that displays the tags from the URL in the list, where each tag is displayed as a separate list item
for example, if you have #tags=red,blue,purple in the URL, the list will be displayed with 3 items
Write a Javascript, that will update the tag list every time the URL hash is changed
Create your own well-structured CSS (Sass / LESS / Stylus...) styles

Additional exercises (optional)

Adding and removing tags
Add an text input and a button to the page
Once the button is clicked the text of the input element is added as a new tag into the URL hash (#tags=red,blue,purple,mytag)
By clicking on an item in the list the item will be removed from the list and from the URL
Wrap the code
Encapsulate the code as a visual component ( using React .js / any other alternative javascript framework you prefer such as Vue.js ... )

Place the component on the page three times – This is not done because this is not clear to me.

Visual appearance
Use some existing style library (material, bootstrap ...)


Thanks.
